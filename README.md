# PythonSTRing

### This repository was used for a study towards the implementation of STR calling tools in a diagnostic environment.
### The bash script "sbatch_Pypeline.sh" was used to commit Python pipelines to the Slurm workload manager for automatic analyses of sample BAM files in a given directory.
### For the tools ExpansionHunter and LobSTR separate bash scripts have been made that were customised for these tools and include implementation of an Rscript to plot and visualise results.
### Python pipelines for ExpansionHunter LobSTR and STRetch can be found in this repository, along with conversion scripts for output files into a CSV file for ExpansionHunter and LobSTR.
### The Python script "Processing_LobSTR.py" was used in the study to filter results for genes AR, ATXN3, C9ORF72 and DMPK as these were the genes that were included in the study.
